# Hackloween Wild Code School 2019 

## Hackathon at Wild Code School 

- As students at Wild Code Scool, we had to use an API (around the haloween theme) to build a website. 
- The challenge lasted 24 hours.
- We were a group of 4 students and decided to build an RPG-like mobile-oriented game (try-and-die).
